Subject: drm/i915: Disallow pin ioctl completely for kms drivers

The problem here is that SNA pins batchbuffers to etch out a bit more
performance. Iirc it started out as a w/a for i830M (which we've
implemented in the kernel since a long time already). The problem is
that the pin ioctl wasn't added in

    drm/i915: Prevent negative relocation deltas from wrapping

Fix this by simply disallowing pinning from userspace so that the
kernel is in full control of batch placement again. Especially since
distros are moving towards running X as non-root, so most users won't
even be able to see any benefits.

UMS support is dead now, but we need this minimal patch for
backporting. Follow-up patch will remove the pin ioctl code
completely.

Note to backporters: You must have both

    drm/i915: Evict CS TLBs between batches

which is also marked cc: stable. Otherwise this could introduce a
regression by disabling the userspace w/a without the kernel w/a being
fully functional on i830/45.

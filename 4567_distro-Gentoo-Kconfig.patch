+		In order to boot Gentoo Linux a minimal set of config settings needs to
+		be enabled in the kernel; to avoid the users from having to enable them
+		manually as part of a Gentoo Linux installation or a new clean config,
+		we enable these config settings by default for convenience.
+
+		Currently this only selects TMPFS, DEVTMPFS and their dependencies.
+		TMPFS is enabled to maintain a tmpfs file system at /dev/shm, /run and
+		/sys/fs/cgroup; DEVTMPFS to maintain a devtmpfs file system at /dev.
+
+		Some of these are critical files that need to be available early in the
+		boot process; if not available, it causes sysfs and udev to malfunction.
+
+		To ensure Gentoo Linux boots, it is best to leave this setting enabled;
+		if you run a custom setup, you could consider whether to disable this.
